# Explore Weather Trends
Explore Weather Trends is a demonstration of basic SQL and spreadsheet skills. The project features a string of SQL queries that explore and extract as .csv files temperature data for Portland and the globe. The .csv files were then opened in Google Sheets to create moving averages and a line graph comparing trends in local Portland temperature and global temperature.
